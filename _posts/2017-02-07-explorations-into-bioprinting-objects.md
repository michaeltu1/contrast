Objectives:

- Optimizing hydrogel and cell culturing protocols for bioprinting
- Building a fundamental knowledge base and supplemental skills for bioprinting
- Facilitating further interest in tissue engineering research technologies

#### 3D Printer Extruder Head Design

Each researcher investigated and presented an original extruder head design
Proposed a dual-syringe system pushed by screws for accuracy with temperature regulated by a heating coil, controlled by the arduino genuino uno

#### Hydrogel Optimization

Bioprinting team split up into five groups: four groups creating hydrogels, one team resolving signal feedback interpolation
Hydrogels synthesized using varying concentrations of sodium-alginate and gelatin performed according to uniquely designed protocols
Technical difficulties arose due to lack of clean, flat-bottomed beakers -- i.e. magnetic stir bars unable to create a nice vortex
Lack of hot plates and stir plates. Forced to share stir plates and the magnetic stir bars clashed against each other

#### All Cells Cultures Died

NIH 3T3 Mice Fibroblast cells were cultured and passaged
Exact cause of cell death is currently unknown, potentially due to over-trypsinization or contamination
